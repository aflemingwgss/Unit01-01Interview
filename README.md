# Unit01-01Interview

Your boss hates giving interviews.  She wants to streamline the process and has asked you to come up with a “bot” that will ask the basic questions and report back to her with a summarized version. 



This way she can walk into the interview and ask the “really tough” questions. (If you were a colour, what colour would you be?  What would you do if you found a penguin in your freezer?)

 

The basic questions she wants the bot to ask are the following:

 

1. The name of the applicant
2. Age
3. Education
4. Hobbies
5. Favourite flavour of ice cream
 

 At the end, the program should summarize the critical data into a paragraph so that your boss can read it before entering the interview room.  Use f-strings

 

Try to be as creative as possible.  You may have to ask a few more questions or break them down to get the answers you want to fit them into your paragraph.
